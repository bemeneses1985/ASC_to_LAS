# ASC_to_LAS
ASC to LAS Converter
This Python script allows you to convert ASCII (.asc) point cloud files to LAS (.las) format using the PyntCloud and laspy libraries. This is useful for working with LiDAR data in applications that require LAS files, such as point cloud viewers and GIS software.

Features
- Reads ASC files and converts them into a point cloud using pyntcloud.
- Creates a new LAS file with the appropriate point format and header information.
- Sets the scale and offset for the LAS file based on the input data.
- Writes the LAS file to disk.

Usage
To use the script, simply run the asc_to_las.py file in your terminal or command prompt. The script takes two arguments: the input ASC file and the output LAS file. Replace your_input_file.asc and your_output_file.las with the appropriate file names.

The script will read in the ASC file, convert it to a PyntCloud object, and then convert that object to a LAS file. The LAS file will be written to the specified output file location.

How to use:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required libraries: pandas, pyntcloud, and laspy.
3. Modify the input_file variable in the script to point to your ASC file.
4. Choose an output file name for the output_file variable.
5. Run the script to convert your ASC file to LAS format.

Requirements
The script requires the following libraries to be installed:
- pandas
- pyntcloud
- laspy (version 2.0.2)

You can install these libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the required libraries as specified in the included requirements.txt file.
