- Creates a new LAS file with the appropriate point format and header information.
- Sets the scale and offset for the LAS file based on the input data.
- Writes the LAS file to disk.

How to use:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required libraries: pandas, pyntcloud, and laspy.
3. Modify the input_file variable in the script to point to your ASC file.
4. Choose an output file name for the output_file variable.
5. Run the script to convert your ASC file to LAS format.
